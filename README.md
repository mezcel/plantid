# Plant Morphology App
 
### This Application Is A Dichotomous Plant Identification Key

This application, in conjunction with a separate image matching software I am also developing, is a reliable way to identify different plant species. It adds an additional degree of certainty to image matching methods and human visual perception alone.

This application was developed in VB.NET because my initial audience consistend of veteran biologists who had a minimal education in programming, yet felt comfortable with Visual Basic.

## How This Application Is Used

### This application is an elaborate dichotomous tree identification key.

* Instruction Steps:
* The end user looks at a plant leaf based on what that person sees as a definitive descriptive characteristic of that leaf.
* The end user selects from an existing list of descritive tems (minimum of one description).
* The software will return a list of known plants which match that description.
